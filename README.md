# Virtual-Radio-Broadcasting
The project, based on Signal Processing, employs sound as a signal and demonstrates various functionalities that can be performed on it. Further, it simulates  complex real-world applications of sound wave/audio by assuming a simpler scenario. These functionalities are made possible with a convenient programming language Python and Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
The operations applied on sound waves are as follows:
1. Read a sound file.
2. Generate sound.
3. Simulate amplitude modulation.
4. Simulate frequency modulation.
5. Simulate frequency demodulation.
6. Record sound and do spectral analysis.
7. Design and analyze filters.
8. Remove noise from a noisy signal.
9. Create music using given notes
